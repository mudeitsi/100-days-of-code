### Day 0: December 15, 2023


**Today's Progress**: I faced a few hiccups in getting my Git and VS tuned and didn't begin on 13th as I had hoped. So I started actual coding today. So ... starting the 100 Days of Code challenge by beginning work on a personal e-commerce project. Today I:
1. created the README.md and project outline. 
2. uploaded the HTML starter file and product images and began working on the JavaScript code.
3 managed to reduce a lot of the HTML code by creating objects and arrays then generating the product's HTML from JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** This seems like a good experience. I already have a few bugs to figure out. ☺️☺️

### Day 1: December 16, 2023


**Today's Progress**: Today I:
1. debugged an image product display error. I had the image URL link wrong. 
2. deleted all the products I created on the Octamart.js/main file.
3. created an array for all products, thus creating a products dataset and saved it as a separate JavaScript file in /data/products.js
4. generated the products' HTML from JavaScript by looping through the products.js dataset.
5. added the products.js script source file onto the HTML page.
6. made the "Add to Cart" button responsive.

**Thoughts:** So far, so good. I still have to look at the "Add to Cart" button's responsiveness. A bug. ☺️☺️

**Today's Progress**: 
It's been a moment. I've faced a few challenges, but I'm back.
The joy of being able to code is when you can get to do more than write a love poem or song for Valentine's Day. You get to be above the ordinary. I've made a simple virtual Valentine's greeting card. An upgrade to love messages.
Enjoy. Happy Valentine's
