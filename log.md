### Day 0: December 15, 2023


**Today's Progress**: I faced a few hiccups in getting my Git and VS tuned and didn't begin on 13th as I had hoped. So I started actual coding today. So ... starting the 100 Days of Code challenge by beginning work on a personal e-commerce project. Today I:
1. created the README.md and project outline. 
2. uploaded the HTML starter file and product images and began working on the JavaScript code.
3 managed to reduce a lot of the HTML code by creating objects and arrays then generating the product's HTML from JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** This seems like a good experience. I already have a few bugs to figure out. ☺️☺️
